Campustry - Project Proposal

What is the proposed name for your Web application? (Make your GitHub repository name similar to your project name).

The name of our web application is Campustry.  Campustry’s GitHub repository can be found here.

Who is the target audience for your Web application?
Campustry’s target audience is college students looking to connect with other students, faculty and alumni on a professional level.

What problem is it intended to solve for that audience?

•	Get to know your fellow students (college classes can be anti-social).
•	See what your colleagues’ academic interests are and what they are working on.
•	Send professional messages to other students and professors.
•	Connect with alumni for networking opportunities.
•	See which courses a professor teaches.

How will it meet the minimum project requirements?

Create – Users can create an account

 



Read – Users can view other student’s and professors accounts

 

Update – Users can update their academic interests and professional projects
Delete – Users can delete information in their profile.  Their profile cannot be permanently deleted, only deactivated

Why is your proposed Web application unique or creative beyond simply meeting the minimum requirements?

Campustry is unique because it is a more professional version of Facebook for college students.  In college, many students don’t know much about their classmates.  Campustry is a place to get to know your classmates on a more professional, rather than a purely social level.  For example, there is currently a stigma attached to sending a random classmate a Facebook message related to a group project but there is no stigma in sending that same person a Campustry message.
