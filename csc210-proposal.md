Campustry - Project Proposal
============================

### Sean Cooke & Kailash Joshi

[Campustry](http://campustry.com/) is an academic, [open source](https://github.com/SeanCooke/Campustry) social media site for college students, professors and alumni.  Campustry’s target audience is people affiliated with universities looking to connect with other students, faculty and alumni on a formal level.  On Campustry *you can...*:

+ Get to know your fellow students (college classes can be anti-social).
+	See what your colleagues’ scholarly interests are and what they are working on.
+	Send professional messages to other students and professors.
+ See which courses a professor teaches.
+	Connect with alumni for networking opportunities.

Users of Campustry can:

> **Create** – Create an account.
>
> **Read**   – View other student’s and professors' accounts.
>
> **Update** – Update their scholarly interests and academic projects.
>
> **Delete** – Remove information from their profile.  A users profile cannot be permanently deleted, only deactivated.

Campustry is different because it is a formal social media site for people associated with universities.  In college, many students don’t know much about their classmates.  Campustry is the place to get to know your classmates on a more professional, rather than a purely social level.
